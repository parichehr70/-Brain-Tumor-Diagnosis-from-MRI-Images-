# -Brain-Tumor-Diagnosis-from-MRI-Images-
Brain tumor is the most important reason of fatality in todayâ€™s world. So, proposing a system to detect tumors in early stage can help patients. The importance of MRI image segmentation is due to represent exact place of White Matter, Grey Matter, and Cerebrospinal Fluid which provide an efficient way to detect brain disturbance such as Dementia, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer, and etc. In this article, a new MRI image segmentation method proposed for tumor diagnosis. The proposed algorithm consist of three stages. At first pre-processing to equalizing input image specially noise reduction with thresholding. Then two features such as edges and edema extract in image segmentation with deep learning technique which used VGG-Net. Then CRF method used in VGG-Net to detect exact area of tumor. BraTS dataset used as input data. Obtained results show that proposed method which named brain tumor detection with VGG-Net and CRF have better performance in comparison to other techniques based on accuracy evaluation criteria which proposed method obtained 98.30% accuracy and sensitivity is 90.51 %.
